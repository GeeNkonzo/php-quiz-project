# PHP quiz project

## Introduction

 I created quiz to practice and apply what I have learned on php. So far the content I have covered on php are introductory. I have learnt variables, loops and sessions. I have that knowledge to create a multiple choice questionnaire of 20 questions that consist of 4 options per question.
