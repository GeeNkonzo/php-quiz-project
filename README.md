# PHP quiz project

## Introduction

 I created a quiz to practice and apply what I have learned on PHP. So far the content I have covered on PHP are introductory. I have learnt more about variables, loops and sessions. I then used that knowledge to create a multiple choice questionnaire of 20 questions that consist of 4 options per question.
